Some of the features of CameraTracker 1.0 v9-AE CC-win-x86-release-64 (G Touch) include:
 
- Automatic camera tracking: CameraTracker analyzes the motion of the camera in your video and generates a 3D camera that matches it. You can then use this camera to create 3D scenes that align with your video.
- Manual tracking options: If you want more control over the tracking process, you can use manual tracking options to adjust the camera parameters, refine the track points, or add or remove track points manually.
- 3D scene creation: CameraTracker lets you create 3D scenes using After Effects' native 3D tools or third-party plugins. You can import 3D models, add lights, shadows, reflections, or depth of field effects, and animate them using keyframes or expressions.
- Ground plane and origin tools: CameraTracker provides tools to help you set up the ground plane and origin of your 3D scene. You can use these tools to align your 3D objects with the horizon and the center of your video.
- Export options: CameraTracker allows you to export your camera data to other applications or formats, such as Cinema 4D, Maya, Nuke, or FBX. You can also export your 3D scene as a video file or a still image.

In this section, we will show you how to use CameraTracker 1.0 v9-AE CC-win-x86-release-64 (G Touch) to create a 3D scene in After Effects. We will use a sample video of a city street and add some 3D text and a car to it.

1. Open After Effects and import the video file into a new composition.
2. Apply the CameraTracker effect to the video layer. You can find it under Effect > The Foundry > CameraTracker.
3. Wait for CameraTracker to analyze the video and generate track points. You can see the progress and status of the analysis in the effect panel.
4. When the analysis is done, you will see a cloud of track points on your video. These points represent the motion of the camera and the features of the scene.
5. Select some track points on the ground plane of your video and right-click on them. Choose Set Ground Plane and Origin from the menu. This will set up the coordinate system for your 3D scene.
6. Click on the Create Scene button in the effect panel. This will create a new 3D camera that matches the motion of your video and a 3D null object that represents the origin of your scene.
7. Add a new text layer to your composition and type some text. Make sure the text layer is 3D and position it above the ground plane using the move tool.
8. Import a 3D model of a car into your composition. You can use any 3D format that After Effects supports, such as OBJ or C4D. Make sure the car layer is 3D and position it on the ground plane using the move tool.
9. Add some lights and shadows to your scene using After Effects' native 3D tools or third-party plugins. You can also add some reflections or depth of field effects to make your scene more realistic.
10. Preview or render your composition. You should see your 3D text and car moving along with your video as if they were part of the original scene.

Congratulations! You have successfully created a 3D scene using CameraTracker 1.0 v9-AE CC-win-x86-release-64 (G Touch). You can experiment with different settings, track points, 3D objects, or effects to create different results. Have fun!
